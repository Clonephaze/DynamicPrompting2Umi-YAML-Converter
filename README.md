## Introduction
This Python script, DynamicPrompting2Umi-YAML-Converter, is designed to convert Dynamic Prompting YAML format to UmiAI YAML format. It checks for the necessary modules (PyYAML and Ruamel.yaml), installs them if they are not found, and then proceeds to convert the YAML file. The script also handles text replacements and formatting to ensure the output is in the correct format.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyYAML module
- Ruamel.yaml module

The script will automatically check for the required modules and install them if they are not found.

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the DynamicPrompting2Umi-YAML-Converter script.
3. Double click the downloaded Python script to run it.
4. When prompted, enter the file path of the YAML file you want to convert or drop the file onto the command window, then press enter.
5. Wait for the script to complete the conversion. The converted file will be saved in the same location as the original file with "Converted" added to the file name.
